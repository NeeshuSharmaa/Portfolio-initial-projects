            <p>
                Ever thought of making your hobby a career or just simply monetizing it as a side hustle?<br> <br>

                <em>
                    Well, I too thought, and just like others I thought if there is something that I really 
                    enjoy doing, why not completely getting into it? <br> In my case, it was about graphic designing. 
                    Even still 2 days ago, my LinkedIn About section read- “I’m open to graphic designing freelancing projects.” 
                    So, a week ago, someone reached out to me asking if I’m up for graphic designing work with them either part-time or freelance.........

            <p>
                <strong>Lesson 1-</strong> The self is being determined not by the experiences themselves but by the meaning we give ‘em. <br><br>
                <em>Whatever we choose be it staying in our comfort zone, suffering from something, not doing the very thing we’re scared of, that’s 
                    all a choice with which we’re trying to accomplish some hidden goal, we’re just not aware ‘what goal?’ as we never think with 
                    this perspective. Next time, think when you find something on default in your life- “what’s my goal behind it? What I’m trying
                    to achieve?”.........</em>
